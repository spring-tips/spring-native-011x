# Spring Native 0.11.x 

## Major Themes for this Video 
* the new AOT engine 
* the free performance bump you get, even on the JRE, shown with `rss.sh`
* the new interfaces, the new service loaders, and the fact that these get run at the build time even though they can now live in the same jar as your autoconfig and everything else and be brought in to the build in the same way as the autoconfiguration.
* the road to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3
